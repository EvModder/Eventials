3 Goals: Configurable, Compatible, Comprehensible
# Eventials
* Every command and feature comes with complete, carefully designed permissions
* Each section can be enabled/disabled in the config
* Carefully structured Time complexity (This plugin won't lag)
* Almost all displayed messages are configurable<br>

Although I plan to eventually do a public release of this plugin, there is currently too much legacy code and dependance on my other plugins for **Eventials** to be very useful to any other server in its current form.
